# Getting Started



### The iCloud Account and the iOS App

###### iCloud Account  

iCloud3 uses the iCloud Location Service to locate your devices (iPhone, iPad, etc). (Go [here](https://www.icloud.com/) for more information). It provides location information for the devices you are tracking using two methods - the people (friends) you have added to the FindMy app (*Find-my-Friends* or *fmf*) and the family members in the Family Sharing List on your iCloud account (*Family Sharing* or *famshr*). iCloud3 selects the most efficient method to use for each device you are tracking based in how you set up the device parameters and how the location information is returned from iCloud Location Services. More about this later.

*Note:* The following documentation will refer to the iPhone (phone) as the device being tracked although it could also refer to a iPad or iWatch.

###### Home Assistant Companion iOS App (iOS App)   

The iOS App keeps track of your zones, their location and size. When you enter or exit a zone, the iOS App issues a state change trigger and updates the device_tracker state of the entity associated with the iOS App. It also issues other location triggers that update the devices location in Home Assistant. iCloud3 monitors the iOS App device_tracker state for zone information and the last_update_trigger sensor for trigger/location changes every 5-seconds. More about this later.

!> The iOS App settings Zone enter/exit, Background Fetch and Significant Location Change location settings must be enabled. 

The HA proximity component also determines distance between zones and the iPhone, determines direction of travel, and other device_tracker related functions. Unfortunately, the iOS App can report old location information that is processed by the HA proximity component leading to GPS wandering and incorrect zone exits.

!> Do not use the proximity component when using iCloud3. iCloud3 duplicates the proximity functions and discards bad location information where the proximity component does not. 

!>You do not need OwnTracks or other location based trackers and you do not need Nmap, netgear, ping or other network monitors.

#### The phone's name creates the device_tracker entity name

The iPhone's (and iPad's) name in set in the phone's Settings App  `Settings App > General > About Name field`. Your iCloud account  does not store the Name field's value, it converts some special characters and spaces to underlines. For example, *Gary-iPhone* becomes *gary_iphone*. iCloud3 uses the iCloud Account name (*gary_iphone*) to identify the phones (or other devices) you want to track.

Tips on naming your phone or other devices:

1. Put your name first (*Gary-iPhone*) not last (*iPhone-Gary*). The iCloud3 sensors and the iCloud3 Stationary Zone name use this name as a prefix, e.g., (*gary_iphone_distance, gary_iphone_stationary, etc.*). The iCloud3 sensors are then all sorted together, the phone can be identified by the first 3 or 4-characters in the Event Log , etc. 
2. Use the device type (iPhone, iPad), not the phone's model (iPhone XS, iPad Air 3). This eliminates changing the phone's name in iCloud3, scripts and automation when you get a new phone.
3. Do not use apostrophes in the name; Use something like *Gary-iPhone*, not *Gary's-iPhone*. This eliminates the confusion when the name is converted, i.e., *Gary's iPhone* may be converted to *garys_iphone*, or *gary_s_iphone*, Another example: *Chris's iPhone* may be converted to *chriss_iphone* or *chris_s_iphone*.

### iCloud Account → iCloud3 ← iOS App

###### iCloud Account  

iCloud3 tracks iPhones using the iCloud Location Services. The name created from the `Settings > General > About > Name field` (*gary_iphone*) links the phone in the iCloud account to the phone being tracked by iCloud3. The iCloud3 track_devices configuration parameter uses the same name (*gary_iphone*) to identify the phone and to tie everything together. 

###### Home Assistant Companion iOS App (iOS App)   

When you install the Home Assistant Companion iOS App (iOS App) on the iPhone, the `Settings > General > About > Name field` is also used when the mobile_app integration device_tracker entity name is created (more info can be found on the `HA Sidebar > Configuration > Integration` screen).  The following describes steps you will need to take to prevent device_tracker entity name conflicts that may happen if the iOS App mobile_integration is set up before iCloud3 is installed.

- **iOS App is installed before iCloud3** - The iOS App creates an HA mobile_app integration device_tracker entity based on the phone's name on the `Setting > General > About` screen. It will probably use the same as used by the iCloud account (*gary_iphone*). Since the iCloud3 track_devices name must be the same as the iCloud account, this creates a conflict. A suffix must be added to the iOS App mobile_app integration device_tracker entity name to make it unique. Instructions are shown in the Setting Up the iOS App chapter..
-  **iOS App is installed after iCloud3** - Since the iCloud3 device_tracker entity name (*gary_iphone*) already exists, the iOS App will add a suffix to it's HA mobile_app integration device_tracker entity name ( *gary_iphone_2*).  This suffix prevents a conflict and nothing else needs to be done. You can rename the suffix to another value (*gary_iphone_app*) and iCloud3 will detect the new name when it starts.

The iCloud3 track_devices parameter specifies the names of the phones you want to track. An example is:

```
devices:
  - device_name: gary_iphone
    name: Gary
    email: gary-456@email.com
    picture: gary.jpg
  - device_name: lillian_iphone
    name: Lillian
    email: lillian-789@email.com
    picture: lillian_jpg
```

!> ◆ The iCloud3 *device name* is the same as the iCloud iPhone's name (*device_tracker.gary_iphone = Gary iPhone*).<br>◆ The iOS App's *device name* is the iCloud3 name with a suffix (*device_tracker.gary_iphone_2*, *device_tracker.gary_iphone_app*, etc.)

When iCloud3 starts, it reads the HA Entity Registry file (*config/.storage/core.entity_registry*) and searches for a mobile_app device_tracker entity beginning with the device to be tracked (*gary_iphone*). If it finds the entity, the mobile_app device_tracker suffix is extracted and iCloud3 monitors that device_tracker entity (*device_tracker.gary_iphone_2*) for zone changes, trigger changes, etc. 

*> If the iOS App is deleted and then reinstalled, there may be several device_tracker entities for the same phone, each having a different suffix (*gary_iphone_2, gary_iphone_3, etc.). iCloud3 displays all the mobile_app device_tracker entities it finds for the phone and selects the last one. This can be overridden on the iCloud3 track_devices configuration parameter discussed later.

### iCloud3 Tracking Methods

iCloud3 tracks your phones using two methods - *icloud* and *iosapp*. As mentioned earlier, there are two ways the location is provided by iCloud Location Services. The pro and cons of each are: 

###### Find-My-Friends (fmf)

The Find-my-Friends tracking method lets you track people you are sharing your location with on the FindMy App. It uses the email address you specify when setting up the devices you are tracking to locate the phone. Be sure to enter it in the configuration file when you set up iCloud3.

- Pros:
  - iCloud only locates the people on your ```FindMy App > People > Share My Location list``` so it is more efficient than the Family Sharing (famshr) tracking method.
  - You can track phones that are not associated with your iCloud account since anyone can be on the ```FindMy > People > Share My Location list```.
- Cons:
  - You have to add the people you want to follow to the FindMy App, send them an invitation and they have to accept the invitation.
  - Starting in iOS v14, when the Find-my-Friends App and the Find My Devices app were combined into the FindMy app, you can not send an invitation to track yourself in the FindMy app. Instead, select `FindMy > Me` and turn on **Use this [device] as My Location**.  You will be located using the Family Sharing method.

###### Family Sharing (famshr)

The Family Sharing tracking method lets you track people on the Family Sharing list on your iCloud account.

- Pros:
  - Everyone on the Family Sharing list can be tracked without you doing anything.
  - iCloud locates all the devices on the Family Sharing list at the same time.
  - Easier to set up since you do not have to send out invitations. You only specify the names of the devices in the Family List that you want to track.
- Cons:
  - All devices on your Family Sharing list are located whether-or-not they are tracked by iCloud3. it can be less efficient than the Find-my-Friends tracking method if you have a lot of devices on the list.

When iCloud3 starts, it loads all the devices (friends) from the FindMy list and from the Family Sharing List. They are used to determine the most efficient method that will provide location and device information. They are shown in the Event Log.

![setup_fmf_icloud3](../images/evlog_stage2a_fmf_famshr_list.jpg)

The Apple support web site has several articles that will help you set up your iCloud account to prepare it for using iCloud3.

- Go [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210400) for *Set up Find My app*
- Go [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201493) for *Set up and use Find My Friends*
- Go [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088) for *Set up Family Sharing*  

###### iOS App (iosapp)

The iOS App reports location information and zone enter/exit triggers when they occur. iCloud3 uses this information to update the phone's location and to determine if the phone is entering or exiting a zone. It requires the iOS App to be installed on the phone. 

You have several options available on how you want to use the iOS App:

- **Use iCloud Location Services and Install the iOS App on all the phones** - You do not have to do anything. This is the normal iCloud3 method of tracking phones.
- **Some of the phones or none of the phones** - Specify the *noiosapp: true* parameter on the phones not using the iOS App,
- **Only use the iOS App to locate the phone, Do not use the iCloud Location Services** - Specify the *tracking_method: iosapp* parameter when setting up the iCloud3 device_tracker platform. The iOS App for location information, requests are sent to the iOS App on the phone using the push notification method built into Home Assistant,

Information about the iOS App (Home Assistant Companion) can be found [here](https://companion.home-assistant.io/).

### Authenticating Your iCloud Account

Home Assistant and iCloud3 needs to be authenticated to access your iCloud account. It requests authentication by asking iCloud to send a verification code via a text message to a trusted device, which is then entered in Home Assistant. The duration of this authentication is determined by Apple, but usually several months.  

!>This will all happen after you configure iCloud3 and restart HA for the first time. 

#### 2-factor-authentication  (iCloud3 v2.3 and later)

When your account needs to be authenticated for the first time or reauthenticated every several months, the screen below maybe displayed on your phone or other device using the iOS App:

When a the device needs to be authenticated, a dot is displayed next to the Notifications on the Home Assistant sidebar in the lower left. Do the following to complete the authorization process:  

1. Select **Notifications** on your Home Assistant screen to open the Notification window. 
1. Select **Configure** to open the Enter Apple ID Verification Code window used to enter the 6-digit verification code.
1. Type the **6-digit verification** code you received on the trusted device you selected in step 2. Then select **Confirm**.

Every 2-months or so, you will need to reauthenticate access to your iCloud account using these procedures. A message is displayed in the Event Log and several other places when this happens. The following shows the windows that will be opened:

![setup_fmf_icloud3](../images/authentication_2fa_steps.jpg)

#### How to Force an Immediate Authentication Request

You may run into a problem where the authentication is never requested, there is an error during the authentication process or you want to reset access to your iCloud Account. 

**Using the Event Log** 

- Go to *Event Log > Actions > Reset iCloud Interface*. Selecting this will do all of the procedures in the *Manual Steps* below and will automatically restart iCloud3. There is no need to restart Home Assistant.

**Manual Steps**

1. A cookie file is created when you start iCloud3 and it tries to authenticate access to your iCloud Account the first time. The file is in the *config/.storage/icloud* directory on the computer running Home Assistant. It's name is the iCloud3 username parameter, the email address you use to log into your iCloud Account without any punctuation (*garyicloud993emailcom*).
2. Delete or rename the cookie file.
3. Go to the *sessions* directory located in the same directory as the cookie file.
4. Delete or rename the *sessions* file. It will have the same name as the cookie file you just deleted or renamed.
5. Restart Home Assistant. The files will be recreated and you should see the HA Notification alert.

### Impact of not using iCloud Location Services or the iOS App

#### What happens if I don't want to use my iCloud Account

If you don't want to use the iCloud Location Services to locate your device, you will not experience the full benefit of iCloud3. Your tracking will be limited to monitoring changes to the iOS App device_tracker entity and the iOS App last_update_trigger for location updates and state changes. iCloud3 will update the tracked devices states relating to when a zone is entered into or exited from, when you do a manual location update and when there are other significant location updates generated by the iOS App. 

> The iOS App (*iosapp*) tracking_method is used if you do not want to use the information provided by iCloud Location Services.

###### When the iCloud Location Services is down

There will be times when the iCloud Location Services is not used or is disabled. Reasons include the Apple iCloud service is down, the iCloud account can not be found, the iCloud account name and password are not correct, there is an error authenticating and verifying the iCloud account, etc. In these cases, iCloud3 will use the *iosapp* tracking method and try to reconnect every 15-minutes.

The following occurs:

- iCloud3 will rely on iOS app to provide Zone enter/exits, Background Fetch, Significant Location Update and Manual triggers to know where the phone is located.
- iCloud3 will not poll the phone on a regular basis since it can't access the iCloud Location Service. The decreasing interval as you approach Home or another zone will be not be done. Automations and scripts based on a short distance from home will not trigger. Automations and scripts triggered on a zone change should continue to work.
- The phone is not located when HA starts by the iOS App. It may take a few minutes to process the next iOS app notification to locate the phone.

#### What happens if I don't want to use the iOS App or the iOS App is not set on the phone

iCloud3 monitors changes to the iOS App device_tracker entity and the iOS App last_update_trigger for location updates and state changes that indicate if you have entered into or exited from a zone. If you do not use the iOS App, you will not receive location updates and zone changes on a timely basis. iCloud3 will enter into or exit from a zone the next time it gets location information from iCloud Location Services, based on the polling interval, which may be 2-hours or more after the event occurred.

!> iCloud3 can not enter and exit zones when it happens If the iOS App is not installed on the phone.

See *Chapter 1.4 Setting up the iOS App* for information on how to set up the iOS App. This must be done on every phone you are tracking.
