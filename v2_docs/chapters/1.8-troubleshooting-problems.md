# Troubleshooting Startup Errors

Things can go wrong during any of these steps from logging into Apple iCloud, invalid device identification data, not being able to find the device in the iCloud account, location GPS errors, etc. The Event Log can help identify and solve these issues. 

Below are sample screens showing authentication errors and device errors.

The following messages may be displayed.

### No devices to track message
iCloud3 scans through the list of devices that have been set up in the Family Sharing list and the Find-my-Friends (FindMy App) and lists them in Stage 2a as shown above. If it can not match the device name in the Family Sharing list or the email in the Find-my-Friends list, that device will not be tracked. The reasons may include:

1. The device name does not match the names in the phone's General > Setting > About > name field.
2. The email address of the person to follow is incorrect.
3. The person that was send an invitation to be share their location has not accepted the invitation.
5. The person you want to follow was never sent an invitation from the FindMy App.
6. The username or password is invalid and the account can not be authenticated. 
7. You can not connect to iCloud Location Services.

### The iOS App device_tracker entity was not found in the Entity Registry

The iCloud3 device_name (gary_iphone), the name on the phone (Gary-iPhone) *(Settings App > General > About > Name)* and the name in the iOS App (Gary-iPhone) *(HA Sidebar > App Configuration > General > Name field)* must be the same. When the iOS App mobile app integration is added to HA, a suffix is added to make it's entity id unique. More about this is in chapter *1.4 Setting up the iOS App*.

iCloud3 scans the entity registry when it starts or is restarted on the Event Log > Actions > Restart iCloud3 looking for the a mobile app device_tracker entity starting with the device_name and ending with a suffix (gary_iphone_2). This error is displayed when  searching for a device_tracker entity that starts with the device_name and ends with a suffix and no device_tracker entity was found. The reasons may include:
1. The device_name configuration parameter is not correct. iCloud3 displays the mobile app device_tracker entities it found in the Event Log > Stage 3. Review the list and correct the name on the configuration parameter.
2. The name in the App Configuration is different than the one on the phone or the device_name in the configuration parameters. Correct them so they all are the same.
3. The name is the same but the iOS App was added before iCloud3. In this case, the mobile app device_tracker will not have a suffix (gary_iphone). HA may then add a suffix onto the device tracker entity for iCloud3 (gary_iphone_3). Since the iCloud3 name and the iCloud account must be the same, add a suffix to the device_tracker entity name for the mobile app using the HA Configuration > Entities window and restart HA.

### The phone does not go to an Away state when you exit a zone

Not changing to Away when you leave a zone means iCloud3 is not getting the zone exit trigger from the iOS app. Check the following:

1. The device name for the iOS app is not the same as the phone and the device name parameter. Check it at *General > Name* field in the iOS app. See [Chapter 1.2 Getting Started/iCloud Account → iCloud3 ← iOS App](chapters/1.2-getting-started?id=icloud-account-→-icloud3-←-ios-app) for more information.
2. The HA mobile app integration is not installed. Install it at *Configuration > Integrations*. See [Chapter 1.4 Setting up the iOS App/Install and prepare the iOS  App](chapters/1.4-setting-up-iosapp?id=install-and-prepare-the-ios-app) for more information.
3. The iOS App device_tracker entity is not found in the HA Entity Registry when iCloud3 starts. The device_tracker entities for the iOS App are listed in the Event Log [Stage 3](chapters/1.6-configuring-starting-icloud3?id=stage-3-identify-the-ios-app-mobile_device-entities) and [Stage 4](chapters/1.6-configuring-starting-icloud3?id=stage-4-configure-the-tracked-devices) for the phones that were found in the HA Entity Registry and how iCloud3 set them up.
4. The iOS app device_tracker.[devicename_suffix] entity is not being updated by the iOS app. Check the *Developer Tools > States* for the device tracker entities to see if they show the zone name when you are in a zone and not_home when you are not in a zone.
5. Review the iOSApp Monitor in the Event Log to see if any iOS App triggers are being detected. Check the *Event Log > Actions > Show iOSApp Monitors*. Look at the state change and trigger change values and times they changed. See [Chapter 1.4 - Setting up the iOS App/iOS App Triggers and the Event Log iOSApp Monitor](chapters/1.4-setting-up-iosapp?id=ios-app-triggers-and-the-event-log-ios-app-monitor) for more information.

### The see service is not supported for this entity device_tracker

This error occurs when the iOS App integration was installed and it's device_tracker entity name is using the same name as iCloud3. The iOS App device_tracker entity name needs to be changed so it is different than the iCloud3 device_tracker entity name.

More information can be found here:

- Chapter 1.1, Getting Started, iCloud Account → iCloud3 ← iOS App
- Chapter 1.4, Setting up the iOS App, Setting the *device_tracker entity* name created by the iOS App

### Updating to a New Phone

When you buy a new iPhone and use your old phone to initialize the new one, you usually do the following:

1. Turn on the new phone, go through the initial setup screens and then use the old phone to initialize the new one.
2. Turn off FindMy on the old phone.
3. Sign out of your iCloud account on the old one.
4. Erase all settings on the old phone.
5. Turn off the old phone
6. Sell your old phone, give it to someone else, send it back to Apple for a credit or something else.

Just doing this does not remove it from your Apple iCloud account. It will still be listed with the same name as your new one and will create problems tracking the new phone. iCloud3 will find two phones with the same name when it starts and will not know which one should be tracked since they have the same name. Internally, Apple uses an Id number to identify the device, not the phone's name. iCloud3 will try to track the last phones in the internal device table in your iCloud account but might not be picking the correct phone.

After you have initialized the new phone and before you Erase all settings on the old one,  do the following:

1. **On the old phone, change the phone's name on the *Settings > General > About* screen**. This is not required but it is helpful in making sure you do the next step correctly.
2. **On the new phone, open Settings > iCloud Account** (your picture at the top). The devices in your iCloud account are listed at the bottom of the screen. At this time, both the old and new phones are listed, along with any other devices you may have. If you still see the old phone and the new phone listed and you did step 1 above, wait a few minutes to give Apple's iCloud servers time to refresh. Then try again.
3. **Select the old phone in the list**. The device type (iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13, etc) is displayed below the name to help identify the old phone. The old phone is easier to identify if you changed the name in step 1 above.
4. **Verify that FindMy and iCloud Backup is off**. If it is still on, make sure you have not selected your new phone.
5. **Select Remove from Account**. This will permanently delete the old phone from your iCloud account. iCloud3 will now find one device with the phone's name during startup and the your new phone will be tracked.
