# Setting up your iCloud account



### iCloud3 Tracking Methods

The previous chapter described the tracking methods you can use.

- **iCloud Location Services** - This tracking method combines the two ways iCloud Location Services can provide location information for your phone.

  - **Family Sharing (famshr)** - The people you want to track are on your Family Sharing list on your iCloud account, along with other Apple devices you don't want to track. Remember, when you use this tracking method, iCloud will locate all of the devices whether you are tracking them or not.

  - **Find-My-Friends (fmf)** - Uses the people that you are sharing your location with on the FindMy App. This is probably most efficient method to use since it only tracks people that are in the FindMy people list and lets you track people that are not on your Family Sharing List.
- **iOS App (iosapp)** - This tracking method does not interact with the iCloud account to located the phones and relies only on the iOS App for zone enter/exit and location data. iCloud3 will react to the phone's device_tracker state entity and monitor location changes triggered by various events. It can be used to track the phone when there are problems authenticating and verifying the iCloud account and HA server due to 2fa security issues.

#### Tracking yourself on the FindMy App

The FindMy app does not let you track yourself. You can not send an email invitation to yourself but you can indicate that this phone should be used to track yourself. Do the following:

- On the *FindMy App > Me* window, scroll down and select the **Use This iPhone as My Location**. 

You will be tracked using the Family Sharing tracking method.

*Note:* If you have been using an iPhone when there was a Find-my-Friends app and a Find-my-Device app (before they were combined into the FindMy app in iOS v14), your email address may be in your Find-my-Friends list. If so, you will be the Find-my-Friends tracking method will be selected for you if you specified your email address in the configuration parameters. When iCloud3 starts, all of emails that are available is displayed in the Event Log - Stage 2a initialization.
