# Quick Start Guide

### The Basics - How iCloud3 works

iCloud3 operates on a 5-second cycle and monitors triggers and notifications issued by the HA iOS App. These include Zone Enter/Exit notifications and various location updates (Background Fetch, Significant Location Update, Manual transactions, etc). When one is detected, it determines if the location update current before it is processed. Transactions older than 2-minutes are discarded. Additionally, to minimize GPS wandering and out-of-zone state changes, transactions within 1km of a zone are discarded when the device is in a zone.  Every 15-seconds, it determines if any devices needed to request a location update from iCloud Location Services and, if so, it issues the request, validates the results and updates the location, calculates the distance from the tracked zone and determines when the next request should be issued. It uses the phones and other devices in the iCloud Family Sharing list and being followed in the FindMy App.

iCloud3 polls the device on a dynamic schedule and determines the polling interval time based on:

- If the device is in a zone or not in a zone. The zones include those you have configured and the special *Stationary Zone* created by iCloud3 and used to minimize polling if you haven't changed your location in a while (shopping center, friends house, doctors office, etc.).
- A 'line-of-sight' calculated distance from the Home or other zone to your current location using the GPS coordinates.
- The driving time and distance between Home or another zone and your current location using the [Waze Route Calculator](http://www.waze.com) map/driving/direction service.
- The direction you are going â€” towards Home or other zone, away from the zone or stationary.
- The battery level of the device if the battery level is available.
- The accuracy of the GPS location and if the location returned by the iCloud Location Service or the iOS App is 'old'.

The above analysis results in a polling interval. The further away from Home or other zone and the longer the travel time back to the zone, the longer the interval; the closer to the zone, the shorter the interval. The polling interval checks each device being tracked every 15-seconds to see if it's location should be updated. If so, it and all of the other devices being tracked with iCloud3 are updated. With a 15-second interval, you track the distance down 1/10 of a mile/kilometer. This gives a much more accurate distance number that can used to trigger automations. You no longer limited to entering or exiting a zone. 

Another custom component module (`pyicloud_ic3.py`) is responsible for communicating with the iCloud Location Services to authenticate the iCloud account and to locate the devices associated with the account using either Find-my-Friends or Family Sharing tracking methods.

### Guide to installing, setting up and using iCloud3

There are a number of steps you must take to get iCloud3 installed, track your devices, interface with your iCloud account and the iOS App you have installed on your phones, configure iCloud3, use the Event Log to help monitor location changes and solve tracking and set up problems, etc. This guide will help you get going with iCloud3. 

The following steps will guide you through setting up and using iCloud3:
