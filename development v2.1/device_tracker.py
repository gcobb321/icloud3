Special Note: I want to thank Walt Howd, (iCloud2 fame) who inspired me to
    tackle this project. I also want to give a shout out to Kovács Bálint,
    Budapest, Hungary who wrote the Python WazeRouteCalculator and some
    awesome HA guys (Petro31, scop, tsvi, troykellt, balloob, Myrddyn1,
    mountainsandcode,  diraimondo, fabaff, squirtbrnr, and mhhbob) who
    gave me the idea of using Waze in iCloud3.
                ...Gary Cobb aka GeeksterGary, Vero Beach, Florida, USA

Thanks to all

VERSION = '2.1rc3'
'''
v2.1
- iCloud3 will have HA reload the zone configuration when iCloud3 is restarted. You can add new zones to HA using the Configuration/Zones Sidebar screen or zone configuration file and then restart iCloud3 using the button on the Event Log Card to reload the zone information without restarting HA. Be sure to forse restart the iOA App to also reload the new zones.
- Buttons were added to the iCloud3 Event Log Card to display the Debug Log items on the Event Log Card like it does in the HA log file and to restart iCloud3 that reset all variables, reauthenticate the iCloud account, relocate all of the devices, display any start up errors, etc.
- Changed the look of the iCloud3 Event Log Card to group log items when the device is successfully located.
- The iOS App does not automatically reload zones when a new zone is added. The result is the iOS App does not know about the Stationary Zone if the iOS App is running on the device (iPhone, etc) before iCloud3 loads and creates the Stationary Zones. If the iOS App is force closed via the App Switcher and reloaded, it downloads the zones again, including the Stationary Zone. Not having the Stationary Zone loaded on the iOS App means the iOS App will not send a Zone Exit trigger to HA when you leave the Stationary Zone. The zone exit will be caught when another trigger is recognized. If this occurs, a message is sent to the device that it left the Stationary Zone without an exit trigger and recommends the iOS App be force closed and restarted to reload the zone information. This alert will be sent up to 5 times in one day. 
- The Stationary Zone center is relocated when it has moved more than 10 meters from the last poll.
- The Stationary Zone is now set up 1km north of Home if north of the equator or 1km South of Home if south of Home. This solves the problem of HA Map and Zone Configuration screens being completely zoomed out to show the initial Stationary Zone location at the North Pole. 
- The Stationary Zone is no longer hidden when you leave it but still shows on the HA Map screen. It's radius is reduced to 3 meters and will be reset to 2 times the Home Zone radius when it is needed again.
- Since each device can have its own Stationary Zone, the device's icon is now the first letter of the Friendly Name associated with the device. It is displayed on different backgrounds if there is more than one device with the same first initial. The first background displayed is a filled-box, followed by a filled-circle, an outlined-box, an outlined-circle, and the initial itself.
- Other internal changes.

v2.0.6b
- The pyicloud_ic3 cookie file used to store Apple iCloud cookies file location was changed from /config/icloud to /config/.storage/icloud. This is the same location used by the HA Apple iCloud integration. The iCloud3 authentication cookies will now be shared if the iCloud Integration is installed. This may generate a one-time notification from Apple about a new account login.
- The Entity Registry is read when iCloud3 is started to extract the iOS App entities to be monitored. The directory location of the Entity Registry is now retrieved from HA rather than being hard coded in iCloud3. This can still be overridden using the 'entity_registry_file_name' configuration parameter.
- The person's name is extracted from the devicename by removing the device type (iPhone, iPad, etc) and any special characters. That name is then displayed on the iCloud3 Event Log card and on other messages generated by iCloud3. You can now specify the person's name associated with the device on the tracked_devices parameter line. This has nothing to do with the HA Person entity.
- Added the 'sensor.name' sensor that displays the person's name associated with the device. It can be included or excluded using the 'name' sensor code.
- The Sensor Name Prefix parameter on the tracked_device configuration line has been removed. The devicename is now used at the beginning of the sensors created by iCloud3.
- Added a 'log_level: debug+rawdata' configuration parameter that will dump the raw iCloud data to the HA log file as it is returned by pyicloud_ic3. The 'log_level: debug' will continue to add general debug information to the HA log file.

- In some cases, no contact data was being returned from the iCloud Find-my-Friends Service. Because of this, iCloud3 could not match the email address on the tracked devices parameter with the iCloud contacts and no devices would  be tracked. Now, if this occurs, a secondary source of contact identification will be used and the device will be tracked. However, the Contact's First Name is not available in this secondary data source so it should be specified on the tracked devices configuration parameter (see above).
- Cleaned up some event and error messages.
- PyiCloud_ic3.py (the iCloud Location Services interface module) will now display raw data for all data requests. To display this information, include the `custom_components.icloud3.pyicloud_ic3`: debug` statement in the `logger:/logs:` section of the HA configuration.yaml file. For example:
        loggger:
          default: info
          logs:
            custom_components.icloud3.pyicloud_ic3

v2.0.6a
- The picture specified on the track_devices parameter was only being displayed on the Lovelace card if the device was specified in the `known_devices.yaml` file. The `entity_picture` attribute was added to the device_tracker entity (e.g., `device_tracker.gary_iphone`) so it would always be displayed.
- Added the Battery Status (batstat) and Badge (badge) codes to the create_sensors and exclude_sensors list.
- If there was an iCloud authentication error 5-times, the tracking method is reset from fmf/famshr to IOSAPP. If iCloud3 was then restarted, the IOSAPP tracking method would still be used after the restart instead of being reset to the configuration file tracking method (fmf/famshr). This has been corrected.
- Fixed the Lovelace documentation error for the 4x3 layout.
- The Event Log message is now being verified to make sure it is not blank.

v2.0.5
- Fix a bug introduced in v2.0.4 where a coding error caused NoRoute information to be returned Waze.
- Added GPS location to Stationary Zone Set Location Evet Log message.
- Reset the Stationary Zone to it's base location (90, 180) when an update is being done, the device is in a non-Stationary zone and the Stationary Zone is set to a valid location.
- Raw contact data from the 'username' non-2fa iCloud account will be added to the HA log file when setting up the FmF tracking method. Add the 'log_level: debug' parameter to the iCloud3 configuration and restart HA. Go to 'Sidebar>Developer Tools>Logs' to see the Log entries. Look for "___ Raw iCloud Contact Data _______" and review the raw data for each contact on the following line. It will be in json format, e.g., 'emails': ['gary_2fa_acct@email.com', 'gary_456@tw'].

v2.0.4
- When the device's location, interval and next poll information were being updated, there were times when the state was 'stationary' but it had actualy moved into another zone. This might be caused by zones being close together, by no zone exit notification from the ios app or by the next update trigger being processed before the zone exit trigger had been received. This caused the device's location to be reset to the old location instead of the new location. This has been fixed.
- Waze history data is used to avoid calling Waze for route information when you are near another device or in a stationary zone with accurate Waze route information. If you were in a stationary zone and entered another zone without a zone exit trigger, the Waze history was still pointing to the old stationary zone. The old location information was being used for distance and interval calculations instead of the new location information.  A check was added to always refresh the Waze route information when the state changes.

v2.0.3
- Fixed a problem with a malformed message that displayed old location information in the Event Log.
- Added a list of devices that are tracked and not tracked for the Family Sharing (famshr) tracking method. This is created when the iCloud account is scanned looking for the devices in the track_devices configuration parameter.

v2.0.2
- Fixed problem calculating distance and intervals for a second zone.
- If the device_tracker.state is 'stationary' when the next update time is reached and you have moved into another zone that is not stationary, the 'zone' attribute is correct because it is based on the device's location values but the device_tracker.state is still 'stationary' instead of the zone the device is now in. This has been fixed.

2.0.1
- If no location data was available while calculating the distance from Home using Waze, iCloud3 would go into an error correction loop and hang up. This has been corrected.
- If the a `location` request was made using the `icloud3_update` service and the `notify.mobile_app_devicename` service was not available, an unformatted error would be added to the HA log file that did not correctly explain the error. A friendly error message better explaining the problem is now added to the Event Log and HA log file.
- Stationary zone location information was not being refreshed correctly on subsequest polls. It was showing as (None, None) in the HA log file and may have generated an error message or used the wrong location when moving back to the center of the stationary zone. This has been corrected.
- Using the FamShr tracking method generated an 'IndexError: tuple index out of range' error message and would not iCloud3 load. This has been corrected.
- Additional error checking has been added to recover from situations when no location information was available when calculating the distance moved from the last location to the current location. If this happens, the distance moved will be 0km.
