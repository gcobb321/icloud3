## 🍎 iCloud3 v3.3.4 ()
### APPLE ACCOUNTS
- Errors occurring when validating a username/password or authenticating Apple account have been enhanced to provide more information.
- Updated the PasswordSRP Authentication method to display more information messages if an error occurred.
- Updated the PasswordSRP Authentication method to try to detecd accounts that could not be verified and needing a password change.
- Enhanced the internal procedures for adding a new Apple account, relogging into an existing account and authenticating it.
-
### OTHER
- Updated the Waze Route Time/Distance process to use Google's new data request URLs.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- If adding an Apple account on the _Update Apple Account screen_ was unsuccessful, an error would occur rebuilding the Apple accounts list.
- If the username or password did not change and the Apple account was not logged into, nothing would happen when trying to log in again. Now, the login will be retried.
- If a login was successful, the _NOT LOGGED INTO_ error message was not cleared on a successful login.




## 🍎 iCloud3 v3.3.3 (11/22/2025)
### Account Reauthentication
- Fixed a `Config flow could not be loaded: 500 Internal Server Error Server got itself in trouble` error when trying to reauthenticate the Apple account after selecting the Orange Reauthentication button on _Devices & settings > iCloud3_. It did not occur when selecting the _Authenticate Apple Account Sign-In_ screen.
### Startup
- The results of the Internet Connection Test done during Startup, Stage 2 are now displayed in the Event Log and icloud3.log file.


## 🍎 iCloud3 v3.3.2 (11/21/2025)
### Apple account Error 503/Password SRP handling
- Fixed several issues in the PasswordSRP handler dealing with verifying the password. This was creating the Server Not Available 503 error resulting in password authentication failures and login delays.
### Update Apple Account screen
- When the Apple account password is changed, it needs to also be changed on this screen, otherwise the account will not be logged into on the next iCloud3 restart. Fixed a problem verifying the new password, relogging into the account and requesting an authentication code.
- *Multiple Apple accounts* - Fixed a problem when going from this screen to the *Authenticate Apple Account Sign-in screen. The selected account was not being reselected.
### Authenticate Apple Account Sign-in screen
- *Multiple Apple accounts* - When several accounts need to be authenticated, the correct one was not being reselected after requesting new code.
- Improved handling of logging into the Apple account
- The Apple account login attempt would only be retried when the username and password was changed even though the account was not logged into. This as been fixed.
### Hardware Security Keys (YubiKey)
- Removed the security key selection fields from the *Authenticate Apple Account Sign-in* screen until I get it working.



### iCloud3 ➤ v3.3.1
### 🚩 Updates to iCloud3 v3.3
- Fixed the _TypeError: iCloudSession.request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'retry_cnt'_ error
- Reverted displaying Security Key messages on the Authenticate Apple Account Sign-in screen
- Changed the way Apple cookie files were handled to see if it helped cure the 'Server Not Available 503' error. It didn't.
- The Apple Cookies are now being logged in the _icloud3.log_ file when the Apple account is logged into.

### iCloud3 ➤ v3.3
### 📢🚩✨💥🚀🎁 iCloud3 works again, you can log into your Apple Account
- **Comments**
    - I believe Apple reimplemented the authentication process they introduced last November that caused the same errors. This time, however, the native Python PyiCloud interface had already incorporated the changes that solved the problem. Thanks go to the PyiCloud team headed by @timlaing. It also helped that I was home and not on a cruise ship off the western coast of Africa like last time.
- **Some Notes about the 503 Error you may still see**:
    - Condition 1 - This is a new login, the iCloud session files with the Trust Tokens and Cookies are being created.
    - Condition 2 - You are using multiple Apple Accounts.
    - What happens - One account may login in fine (usually the first one), the other will fail with a _Server/PW-503_ error. This is displayed in the Event Log, Stage 4, the greenbar at the top of the Event Log and in the _iCloud3 Alerts_ sensor (sensor.icloud3_alerts).
    - What to do: Wait about 5-minutes, then restart iCloud3 using _Event Log > Actions > Restart iCloud3_ option. Do it again later if it gave you the 503 Error again.

- **Thanks for the Coffee**
    - For those who encouraged me with the comments and coffee, thank you. I appreciate it.

### ✨ New and Improved Features
- **Apple Account**
    - Added support for accepting updates to Apple's 'Terms of Use' documents.
    - Added _Update Display/Run-Time Parameters_ screen to the _Update Apple Account_ screen
- **Password SRP**
    - Added support for using the PasswordSRP (Secure Remote Password Verification protocol) for verifying the password when logging into the Apple Account. Instead of sending the actual password over the internet, a 256-bit encrypted one-time key is sent to Apple.
    - Special Notes:
      - This may reduce the need for the 6-digit verification code entry (under long term review).
      - There are times when Apple will issue the Verification code popup and iCloud3 has not detected that the code is needed. I have ignored it and have not seen any problems. I have entered it and it was accepted.
    - Added option to enable/disable it on the _Update Apple Account > Update Display/Runtime Parameters_ screen. There may be times when a lot of logins to an Apple account will generate a 503 error and the Password will fail to be validated. Apple is refusing to handle it thinking it is a fraudulent transaction. After 20-30 (?) minutes, restart iCloud3 from the Event Log and it will usually validate and log into the account correctly.
- **Internet Errors**
    - Improved the operation of internet error detection and handling
    - Improved the status messages displayed while monitoring the internet
- **Security Keys (Yubikey) Support** (Incomplete and Currently Disabled)
    - Changed error and status messages in the _Configure_ screens to support Verification Code and Security Key handling
    - Added the ability to show the Security Key Names in the _Configure > Authenticate Apple Account Sign-in_ screen
    - ToDo - Tie into HA to detect the Security Key Name used to authenticate the Apple Account sign-in
- **iCloud Account I/O**
    - *HA Event Loop Errors* - Moved the Internet Connection Error handler and the Apple Account Username/Password validate handler from the HA Event Loop to the iCloud3 thread that runs outside of the Event Loop. This simplified requesting data from the Apple Account, handling internet errors and avoids problems related to doing I/O outside of the Event Loop.
    - *Docker Container* - iCloud3 should no longer have I/O issues related to running in a Docker container (hopefully).
    - *Common icloud.com I/O handler* - Consolidated all internet data request calls through a central point for improved reliability, control and monitoring
- **Startup**
    - Logging into and verifying Apple accounts is now done in _Event Log/Stage 4_ to improve status monitoring
    - Added status messages to the Event Log that show the Apple Account the results of each event during the authentication process
- **Other Changes**
    - Internal changes, module name changes, code cleanup and reorganization


### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fixed several 'NoneType' and unknown variable errors associated with verifying Apple username-password and Internet Errors.


### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.4.2 (9/20/2025)
### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Away Time Zone** - Fixed a problem where the time zone adjustment was reset to the Home zone server time zone when iCloud3 was restarted
- **Apple Account Login** - Fixed a problem where the Apple account server in China was not displaying an error message because the HA server was logged into through a VPN in another country.
- **Other Bugs** - A few other minor bugs were fixed
### ✨ Improvements
- **Dashboard Builder:**
    - When a device is added or deleted, all dashboards are now automatically updated. The new device is added to the Main View when it is displaying Result Summary information or when All Devices are displayed. It is removed from all views when it is deleted.
    - The Dashboard Builder screen has been reformatted


### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.4.1 (8/22/2025)
### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Dashboard Builder** - Fixed a problem where the Dashboard Builder would fail if 'All Devices' was selected from the _Main View Devices_ selection list.
- **Apple Account Login** - Fixed a problem where the error message description was not being set correctly when logging into an Apple Account being added failed.
### ✨ Improvements
- **Dashboard Builder:**
    - The Devices to be displayed on the Main View (All Devices, First 2 iPhones or specific devices) can now be selected for both of the Main View formats (Result Summary & Tracking Details).
    - Changed the Action options description t better describe their functions.



### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.4 (8/15/2025)
### 🐞 Bug Fixes
1. Dashboard Builder:
     - Fixed an error reading the base template and dashboard files that are used to construct new dashboards.
     - Fixed a problem where all devices would be inserted into a dashboards instead of only the selected ones.
2. iCloud3 Log File - Fixed a problem when the log-level was set to 'unfiltered'.

### ✨ Improvements
1. Internet Connection Error - Added the following:
    - The Event Log error description message and alerts are added after the internet has been down for 1-minute to prevent very short dropouts from creating a lot of unnecessary messages.
    - Improved the error detection and testing done when verifying that Apple (icloud.com) can be connected to after the Internet is back online.
    - Added a 1-minute timeout to catch Apple location requests that have not been responded to. This is usually caused by IPv6 being enabled in HA. Appropriate tests and error messages explain that it is probably an IPv6 issue with instructions on how to disable it.
    - Improved the status message display messages.
2. iCloud3 Startup:
    - iCloud3 starts after HA has finished loading to prevent HA from locking up due to any iCloud3 errors.
    - Significantly reduced the startup time when the log_level was set to `debug` (4 devices with 15 sensors went from pver 10-secs to less than 1-sec).
3. Device Tracking - Devices not using the Mobile App (Watches) that are near other devices will be located 1-minute after the other devices have left a zone. This is not perfect and relies on Apple providing updated location data when it is relocated.
4. Device Setup - Added Device Type categories to indicate if the iPad and Watch is WiFi only or Wifi+Cell.
5. Tracking Results - The source of the GPS is displayed on the Event Log when a device's location is updated (GPS, WiFi, Cell, Unknown).
6. iCloud3 Log File:
    - Configuration file records were added to the log file when the log_level is set to `info` or `debug`.
    - Fixed some problems formatting the log_level `debug` records.




### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.3 (7/13/2025)
### 🎉 New and Updated Features
1. **_icloud3_alerts_ sensor** - Errors and Alerts are displayed in the Event log as they are found and summarized in a green bar at the top of the Event Log. These may include device configuration errors, Apple account login errors, Apple account authentication is needed, Internet Connection Errors, etc. The _sensor.icloud3_alerts_ has been also report these errors. This sensor entity can be used to notify a device that an error or alert has occurred.

     Errors are prioritized based on the following - critical (Internet Connection Errors), Apple Account errors (account not found, login errors, authentication needed alert), devices (configuration errors), and other.
     - State Value - The highest priority error.
     - Attributes - The Apple account or Device that encountered the error.
     - Attribute 'message_text' - A text summary of all errors that can be sent to a device using the notify.devicename service.
2. **Internet Connection Errors** - Redesigned the Internet Connection Error Handler to:
    - Improved the detection of Internet Connection Errors
    - Improved the method used to determine when the Interned was restored
    - Improved the progress bar notification on the Event Log to better show that the internet is being checked on a regular basis
    - Added a check to see if apple.com was available after the Internet Connection is restored
    - Added a notification to the _icloud3.alerts_ sensor when the Internet Connection is lost (after 3-minutes) and when it is restored
3. **Apple Username/Password Verification** - When iCloud3 starts, the Apple account username/password is validated to insure it is correct and a successful login will be done. The method of doing this has been improved and now included several fallback methods if one method is rejected by Apple.
4. Added Simplified Chinese Translation - Thanks @lo3612

### 🎉 Improvements
1. **Time Zone** - The Time Zone and UTC offset are now determined from the time zone selected on the Home Assistant user settings screen. Previously the time zone configured for the computer/docker container running Home Assistant was used.
2. **Request Apple Verification Code** - Reduced the time it takes between requesting the new code and then being able to enter it.
3. **Apple Account Username** - Improved hiding the Apple account username in the Event Log and log files.
4. **Optimization** - Continued to reorganize and optimize the iCloud3 code.
5. **Module Structure** - Updated the module and directory names to improve the module file organization.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **Configure iCloud3** - Fixed a problem preventing the Apple devices list to be refreshed when the Verification Code was entered the first time on a new installation.
2. **Tracking** - Fixed a problem displaying the number of devices in a stationary zone when a location update was being processed.




### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.2.3 (5/31/2025)
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **Configure > Sensors** - Fixed a bug on a new install or when resetting the sensors to the default value would cause a '?Battery - not in list'_ error message and any changes would not be saved.



### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.2 (5/24/2025)
### 🎉 Improvements
1. **External & Pingable IP Addresses** - These will be used in future Internet Connection Error notifications and recovery and are now displayed in Stage 1 of the Event Log when iCloud3 starts.
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **iCloud3 Startup Aborted** - Introduced in v3.2.1 - If an error was encountered getting the External IP Address during startup, another error generating the message for the Event Log would stop iCloud3 from starting. This has been fixed.

*Note: iCloud3 v3.2.2.2 was rereleased on 5/24/2025. The v3.2.2 release on 5/23/2025 was still displaying v3.2.1. There were no other changes.*


### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.1 (5/22/2025)
### 🎉 Improvements and New Features
1. **External IP Address** - Added the detection of the External IP Address in preparation for changes to handling Internet Connection Errors. You should notice an entry in the Event Log (_External IP Address > 73.1.225.32 (ipify.org)_) in Stage1 during the iCloud3 startup process. Let me know if this is not displayed or creates an error message.
### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **Configure Error 400: Bad Request** - When iCloud3 had been reinstalled, this error would be generated the next time the Configure Parameters update was requested and the Configure process would abort.
2. **Configure Field Parameters screen** - Fixed a problem changing the unit-of-measure or time display format.
3. **File Permissions Error when requesting a new verification code** - Added a test to ensure the file permissions were correct.
4. **MobApp Notifications** - Fixed an error adding a message to the Event Log when trying to set up Mobile App Notifications and the Mobile App Integration had not been installed.


### iCloud3 ➤ v3.2.0 (5/18/2025)
### 🎉 Improvements and New Features
1. **Reinstalling the iCloud3 Integration** - When the iCloud3 integration is deleted and then reinstalled, a check is made to see if any Apple accounts or Devices have been configured. If any are found, an option is now available to erase the Apple account and Device configuration during the reinstallation.
2. **China GPS Coordinate Conversion (GCJ02, BD09)** - The Apple account server location in China normally reports GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) in GCJ02 values. An option to convert these to WGS84 coordinates has been added to the Apple Server Location on the _Update Apple Account Username/Password_ screen.

### ✨ The Dashboard Builder
The Dashboard Builder is a tool that will create and update dashboards showing iCloud3 tracking results and other device information provided by iCloud3. It is added to the HA Sidebar panel when it is created and can be edited using the HA Dashboard Editor in the same manner as other dashboards. It's name starts with *iCloud3-#* and can be changed to meet your needs. There is no limit to the number of iCloud3 dashboards that can be created.

It is found on the *Configure Settings > iCloud3 Devices & Sensors* menu.

- When the iCloud3 Integration is install the first time, the *iCloud3* is created and added to the HA Sidebar panel.
- When new devices are added on the *Update iCloud3 Devices* screen, they are added to all iCloud3 dashboards *All Info, *Track Results and *Badge, Battery view tabs.*

Each dashboard has six view tabs. The *Main* and *Other Devices* view tabs are built for the selected devices when the dashboard is created. The other view tabs (their name starts with a '*') are recreated for all devices whenever a dashboard is updated. The type of elements that are created are:

- All tracking information (tracking results sensors + tracking status sensors  + device information sensors) as one item
- All tracking information (tracking results sensors, tracking status sensors, device information sensors) as separate items
- Device Badge sensors and Battery sensor as one item in several formats
- Device Battery sensors in several formats

See the *iCloud3 User Guide - Dashboard Builder* [here](https://gcobb321.github.io/icloud3_v3_docs/#/chapters/1cs-dashboard-builder) for more information, example screens and instructions on using it.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **Event Log** - Fixed a problem where the *Configure Settings* menu was not being displayed when using an the Home Assistant Mobile App on an iPad or iPhone logged in using an External Link.  A browser Refresh message will be displayed.
2.  **Stationary Zones** - Fixed a problem where the Device wants to move into a Stationary Zone but couldn't because it was too close (< 200m) to a real zone and 'Too Close' messages were added to the Event Log every 5-seconds. This could happen if you were at the house next door for a long time. Now, a small Stationary Zone is created that can overlap the zone it is close to. The inZone time is set to 5-mins.
3. **Waze** - Fixed a problem doing End-of-Day Waze History file maintenance when the Internet was down.
4. **iCloud3 v2** - Removed all messages related to iCloud3 v2 since v3 has been out for about 2-years.

### iCloud3 Directory Structure
A lot of modules have been added to iCloud3 during the past few years and the directory structure in the *custom_components/icloud3* directory was becoming very large. So I reorganized it. What this means to you:
- **HACS Installation** - If you install using HACS, HACS will take care of everything and you do not have to do anything special.
-  **Manual unzip icloud3.zip file installation** -  If you install iCloud3 by unzipping the icloud3.zip file on the GitHub Releases page, all directories and program modules in the *custom_components/ icloud3* directory should be deleted. Do not delete the *icloud3* directory itself. Then unzip the *icloud3.zip* file into the *icloud3* directory. iCloud3 will still work if you  do not do this, but obsolete program modules will be left in the icloud3 directory.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Release Notes - v3.1.6.1 (2/26/2025)
#### 🎉 Improvements and New Features
1. _Configure > Update Devices_ screen - Added an Action option to open a new screen to update the rarely updated parameters (inzone interval, log zone, track-from-zone, etc).


#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. Fixed a problem restarting after an Internet Connection Error occurred. iCloud3 would get stuck in a loop displaying a 'Paused/Resumed' message on the Event Log and tracking would stop.
2. Event Log - Fixed a problem building the Configure Button URL (THIS CAUSES A BROWSER REFRESH MSG ON ALL DEVICES).
3. Fixed a problem sending a notification to an iPhone that no data has been received from the Mobile App for over 6-hours.
4. Fixed a problem where changes to a device's Friendly Name were not updating the sensors Friendly Name correctly.


### Release Notes - v3.1.6 (2/22/2025)
#### 🎉 Improvements and New Features
1. Apple sends an email to the account owner that a login/authentication was done when the password is used to authenticate the Apple Account. A note is now added to the Event Log when this occurs showing the authentication date/time (PST) in the Event Log message. Hopefully, the time on the email is the same as the login (but it probably will not be). All password logins can be viewed on _Event Log > Show Startup log, Errors & Alerts_.
2. The Apple Account username is now obscured in the iCloud3 log files.
3. The _Data Sources_ ... screen name was changed to _Apple Accounts & Mobile App_ for clarity.
4. Formatting improvements to the _Apple Accounts & Mobile App_ screen.
5. The Apple Server Location can now be selected by Apple Account (Applies to China users).
6. Messages are no longer sent to a phone when there is an Internet Connection error. Phones were being hammered with messages when the Internet connection would cycle between an offline and online state.
7. When Pausing all tracking, the time paused and age is now displayed in the Event Log.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. When iCloud3 started and was setting up the tracked devices, if the Mobile App device parameter was set to 'ScanFor a device' and that device was not found in the list of Mobile App devices, an error was aborting the setup process. This resulted in no Apple account or Mobile App devices being set up correctly. This has been fixed.
2. Fixed some problems accessing Apple Servers in China where the .cn URL suffix was not being appended correctly.
3. Fixed a problem displaying all of the Apple Accounts when multiple Apple Accounts were set up and the first one was not logged into.

#### ☕ Buy me a Coffee
1. Thanks to all that bought me a coffee. I appreciate it.



### Release Notes - v3.1.5.1 (2/11/2025)
#### 🎉 Improvements and New Features
- Improved - Internet connections errors are now detected and monitored. iCloud3 will pause all tracking until the Internet is back up. A status message is displayed in the Event log and a message will be sent to an iCloud3 device using the Mobile App that Home Assistant is Offline.
- Improved - Renamed and reorganized the _Configure > Tracking Parameters_ screen and _Field Formats & Event Log Parmaeters_ screens.
- New - The _Picture Directory Filter_ can now be updated from the _Update Device_ screen _Picture Selection List_.
- New - If no picture is selected for the Device (=None), the Device's icon that will be displayed can now be selected from Home Assistant's 'mdi:' icon image list (default=mdi:account).

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- A location request was sent incorrectly to Apple when logging into or adding a new Apple Account. This caused an incorrect _Invalid Username/Password_ message to be displayed and communication with the Apple account stopped.
- The _Enter/Request Verification Code_ screen was not displaying correctly if there were no Apple accounts that needed to be verified or the Apple account was deleted.
- Waze History time/distance recalculation will no longer run again at midnight if it was run immediately.  An update that is running can now be terminated.
- Fixed a problem creating a 'Server Error 500' loading the iCloud3 integration for the first time.
- Fixed a problem with the 'Away Time Zone' where the times displayed in the Event Log were were off by 12-hours. A Clock was also added to the device's name at the top of the Event Log when it is in an Away Time Zone.





3.1.4.3
### Release Notes - v3.1.4.3 (1/18/2025)
#### General Updates
1. Log File (Improved) -  Updated the methods used to filter email addresses and passwords from being displayed in the iCloud3 log files

#### Configuration Screen Changes
1. Update Apple Account Username Password screen (Fixed) - When adding a new Apple account or changing it's password would create an HA error when initializing the location of all devices in the account. This then caused a connection error message leading to tracking being paused and the the original login to be terminated.
1. Tools (Fixed) - Fixed a problem where the `MENU > Return to the Menu screen' was not selected when the screen was displayed.



3.1.4.2
### Release Notes - v3.1.4.2 (1/12/2025)
#### General Updates
1. HACS (Updated) - Changed the method of launching the routine that checks HACS to see if there is an iCloud3 Update so HA won't complain.
2. Internet Connection Error (Updated) - Improved the handling of problems when the Internet is not available. If an error occurs when iCloud3 is starting, tasks related to connecting to Apple servers are bypassed. All device tracking will be Paused for 20-minutes. iCloud3 will resume tracking to see if an internet connection can be established. If the internet is still down, tracking will be paused for another 20-minutes. The 'Home Assistant is Offline' message will be displayed in the HA Error Logs and as an alert on the Event Log screen.
3. Waze History Nightly Maintenance (Update) - The Waze History Database end-of-day process includes updating the Waze Map Tracking sensor and other activities to tune the data base. Various activity messages were displayed on the first devices 'info' sensor. HA could not keep up with adding these update to the History Database. This was fixed by only displaying a progress counter to the Event Log instead.
4. Other - Various message formatting improvements and other stuff I can not remember.

#### Configuration Screen Changes
1. Apple Account Login (Fixed)
    - Fixed a problem verifying the password before logging into the Apple account when iCloud3 was starting.
    - Fixed a problem where a valid password may fail the initial verification test and an invalid password may pass the validation test.
    - Fixed a problem where a password that failed the initial verification test could not be corrected on _Configure > Data Sources ... > Apple Username/Password_ screen.
2. Update iCloud3 Device  (Fixed) - Fixed a problem where changing the Apple account and/or Mobile App device selection would be saved in the configuration file but not used when iCloud3 was restarted after the Configure update.
3. Sensors (Updated) - Added an Action option to reset the sensor selection values to their initial configuration.
4. Other Tracking Parameters (Fix) - Fixed an error when saving changes on this screen.
5. Tools (New Items) - Added _HA Restart/Reload iCloud3_ and _Correct _2 Sensor Name Error_ correction tools.



3.1.4
.......................
### Release Notes - v3.1.4 (12/24/2024)
1. APPLE ACCOUNT PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION:
    - Reverted back to the old password authentication protocol before the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol was implemented
    - The Password SRP protocol will be tried if the old password authentication protocol fails.
2. ADD ICLOUD3 DEVICE SCREEN (Redesign) - Redesigned the screen so the basic tracking parameters (iCloud & Mobile App devices and picture) are selected on this screen instead of the Update Device screen.
3. UPDATE DEVICE SCREEN (Redesign) - The rarely used fields (inZone & Fixed Interval, Track from Zone, etc) are not displayed if they are using the default values. A check box is enabled to display these fields.
4. TOOLS SCREEN (New Feature) - A `Tools` screen replaces the `Actions` screen on the Configure Menu screen. This is used for configuration file maintenance to reset all Devices Apple Account fields, Delete all Apple Accounts and Devices, Delete all iCloud3 and Apple Account cookie files, etc.
5. STARTUP (Improved) - Error and warning messages have been improved when setting up Apple Accounts and the Mobile App devices. When errors are encountered (devices can not be found, invalid Apple Account information, etc), an attempt will be made to correct the error using known device names and identification codes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and the configuration will need to be updated.
6. ERROR & WARNING MESSAGES (Improved) - Changed various messages to improve readability and simplify the text.
7. MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES - A lot of internal code changes to make messages consistant, alerts all the same format with the samt highlight icons, improve code maintenance and to remove dead code and more.

What's Next:
.......................
1. YubiKey support.
2. Implementation of the Password SRP protocol as the primary method of authentication passwords. It works but asks for the 6-digit verification code constantly. I have things to try but it will need long-term testing to insure the verification code request is minimized.
3. There are times when HA adds a `_2` extension to the device_tracker and sensor entity name when HA is reloaded and the iCloud3 integration is still running. A new Tool will be developed to easily reset these entity names to their correct name without the `_2`.




3.1.2
.......................
### Change Log - v3.1.2
1. INITIAL SETUP (Fixed) - This fixed some issues related an initial install where there are no apple accounts or where the iCloud3 Apple account's first configuration file entry was blank.. This fixes the error message:
    ```
    File "/config/custom_components/icloud3/config_flow.py", line 1974,
        in async_step_update_apple_acct
    self._update_conf_apple_accounts(self.aa_idx, user_input)
    File "/config/custom_components/icloud3/config_flow.py", line 2055,
        in _update_conf_apple_accounts
    if Gb.conf_apple_accounts[0][CONF_USERNAME] == '':
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^
    IndexError: list index out of range
    ```



3.1.1
.......................
### Change Log - v3.1.1
1. LOCATING DEVICES:
    - Added additional checks to insure the Apple Account location data was refreshed during startup and while configuing iCloud3 settings. Fixed a problem where the location information data from Apple was not being initialized properly.
    - Fixed the location refresh not being done that caused the '0 of 0' to be displayed in the Configure Setting screens, leading to the Apple Account selection lists to not be populated.
    - Fixed some problems where 'Locate All Devices = False' would still locate all the devices in the Apple account
    - Added error checking to make sure the Locate All Devices can not be disabled if there were Family devices that
    were assigned to that Apple account. If it was disabled, they would never be located.
2. UPDATE DEVICE SCREEN - Added (and fixed) the TOOLS - RESET DATA SOURCE(S), DELETE DEVICE(S) option where you can reset the device's Apple Account and Mobile App to default values (None) and fixed a problem deleting devices. Reworked the Apple Account selection list to provide more information and identify setup errors.
3. UPDATE APPLE ACCOUNT USERNAME/PASSWORD SCREEN - Added checks to insure Locating All Devices can not be disabled if there are tracked devices assigned to this account that are in the Family list.
4. OTHER THINGS - Changed several things under the covers.


3.1
.......................
### Change Log - v3.1
1. APPLE ACCOUNT LOGIN (Fixed) - Apple changed the method of logging into the Apple Account to use Secure Remote Password verification where a hash-key is calculated from the password by both iCloud3 and Apple. The hash-key, instead of the password, is sent over the internet. Apple then compares the hash-key sent by iCloud3 to it's hash-key to determine the validity of the password. Note: In a few cases, the hash-key algorithm used by iCloud3 may not be the same as Apple for a valid password and you will need to change your password.
1. MULTIPLE APPLE ACCOUNTS (New) - iCloud3 now supports tracking devices from more than one Apple Account. The accounts are setup on the 'Configuration > Data Sources' screen and devices can be tracked from any apple account and the d if the device is set up as an account owners deviceThe Primary account belongs to the person with the main Family Sharing list as it always has. Secondary accounts can also be configured and devices from those accounts can be tracked. The Apple Account for the specific iCloud3 device is selected on the Update Devices screen as it always has.
2. FAMSHR - Everything called FamShr has been changed to iCloud.
2. THE APPLE ACCOUNT (Improved) - Logging into the Apple Account is now started before the beginning the HA process that creates the device_tracker and sensor entities. Both processes now run concurrently, eliminating (or reducing) any delays waiting for the Apple Account device data to be returned. The result is iCloud3 starts up faster.
3. APPLE ACCOUNT & MOBILE APP DEVICE ASSIGNMENT (Improved) - The results of matching the Apple Account iCloud devices and the Mobile App devices during startup are displayed in the Event Log. This has been simplified and is easier to read.
4. CONFIGURATION SCREENS (Improved) -
    - Saving changes is faster.
    - The iCloud3 Devices screen indicates if there is a problem with the iCloud or Mobile App device selection.
    - Update Devices screen - Impoved selection of Apple Account and Mobile App devices.
5. MISSING APPLE ACCOUNT DEVICES (Improved) - Sometimes, an iCloud device's information is not returned from iCloud when iCloud3 starts. The error recovery and data request retry routines have been rewritten to only retry setting up devices with the error. This greatly simplifies and reduces the steps needed to retrieve the data from iCloud.
6. WAZE & WAZE HISTORY (Improved) - Improved the error checking, added retry on error conditions and updated the History database recalculation routines to better support concurrent operations.
7. APPLE ACCOUNT DEVICE STARTUP ERRORS (Enhanced) - Improved the handling and reporting duplicate and missing Apple Account devices.
8 STARTING/RESTARTING ICLOUD3 -
    - Device Sensors (Fixed) - They were being reinitialized when Restarting iCloud3 when they shouldn't have been.
    - Mobile App entities (Fixed) - They are no longer being reinitialized when iCloud3 is restarted on a configuration change or Event Log restart request. This includes the device_tracker, battery, trigger and notify entities..
    - Improved messaging and fixed miscellaneous bugs



3.0.5.2
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.5.2 (6/8/2024)
1. HA I/O ERROR FROM EVENT LOOP (Fixed) - HA was complaining about doing I/O (HACS file) outside of the Event Loop. Changed the method of doing I/O to use HA routines for the configuration file, restore state file and HACS file.
2. FROM_ZONE ERROR (Fixed) - Normally the TrackFrom Zone and NextUpdate Zone is the Home zone. Added a check to set it to Home if it had never been set.


3.0.5.1
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.5.1 (5/25/2024)
1. MOBILE APP (Fix) - Fixed a problem where the device's Mobile App data source would be disabled (reset to NotUsed) if the HA Mobile App Integration was set up after the Mobile App's initial locate had been completed.
2. TRANSLATION FILE (new) - Added Chinese (Simplified) translation (@MagicStarTrace)

### Change Log - v3.0.5 (5/18/2024)
1. HACS UPUDATE ALERT (New) - The HACS Integration information will be check on a regular basis to see if a newer version of iCloud3 is available.
2. ICLOUD ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATION/FAMSHR DEVICES LIST (Fixed) - During startup ("Stage 4), the iCloud Account access is set up and the devices in the Family Sharing List is read. If a problem occurred, iCloud3 would retry this 10-times to see if the error was corrected. However, the iCloud data was not being reread and the old data was being used. The iCloud data is now reread correctly when trying to recover from this error.
3. UPDATE DEVICES SCREEN (Fixed) - When upgrading a device (iPhone, iPad, Watch) and both the old and new devices are still in the Family Sharing List, the new device was being set back to the old device the next time iCloud3 was started.
4. LOCKED ICLOUD ACCOUNT (New) - An error message is displayed in the HA logs and on the Event Log if the iCloud account is locked.
5. EVENT LOG (Fix) - An 'Unbound event_recd' error would display when the length of the the event text > 2000 characters (@ehendrix23).


v3.0.4
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.4 (5/11/2024)
1. ADD DEVICE (Fixed) - An 'Out of Range' error message was encountered adding the first device.
2. DIRECTION OF TRAVEL (Improvement) - Tweaked the AwayFrom direction override when approaching Home after the previous directions were Towards.
3. Event Type DEPRECIATED EOORO MESSAGE (Fixed) - This was a warning about the removal of the EventType from HA next year. It has been removed.
4. RAWDATA LOGGING - Changed some formatting of the log to better filter device messages.


v3.0.3
.......................
### Change Log - v3.0.3 (5/1/2024)
1. ALERTS (New) - An alert message is displayed on the Event Log and in the _alert_ attribute on the device's device_tracker and badge entities until it has been resolved. Examples of alerts are a startup error, no gps data, the device is offline, the battery below 20%, and tracking is paused. The alert attribute can be used in an automation to trigger sending a message to any device using the Mobile App. See the _Reference > Devices and Other Alerts_ chapter in the iCloud3 docs [here](#/chapters/7.6-alerts) for more information and example automations.
2. BATTERY (Improvement) - The battery information attribute has been added to the device's device_tracker and badge entity. It shows the battery level, charging state, when the information was updated and the source of the data. The charging status text has been changed to 'Charged', 'Charging', 'NotCharging', 'Low' and 'Unknown'.
3. UPDATE SENSOR (Fixed) - An 'AttributeError' message has been fixed. It was caused by trying to update the sensor before the sensor had been set up.
4. CONFIGURE SETTINGS > ICLOUD ACCOUNT AND MOBILE APP screen (Fixed) - Changing iCloud account information (Username or password) was not being saved correctly so restarting iCloud3 would still use the old account. A Log Off option was added to initialize the iCloud Account username/password fields.
5. DIRECTION OF TRAVEL (Improvement) - When Driving towards Home, the calculated straight line distance is used to determine the travel direction ('Towards'). The direction would momentarily  change to 'AwayFrom' if the distance from Home increased due to a curve in the road or you were stopped at an intersection. It would then change back to 'Towards' on the next update. In this case, the direction will not be changed and will remain 'Towards'.
6. Other minor code changes, tuning and code cleanup.



v3.0.2 - 3/30/2023
.......................
1. ICLOUD SERVER ERROR MESSAGE (Fixed) - When the iCloud servers did not respond with location information, the 'no response from iCloud servers' error was displayed correctly. This was followed by another unrelated error which should have not been displayed.
2. ALERTS, STARTUP ERRORS, WARNING MESSAGES (New) - Unusual errors or warning events for iPhones, iPads, and Watches are displayed in a green bar on the first line of the Event Log whenthe event occurs. The message will continue displaying until the event is corrected. This includes (1) startup errors, (2) no data received from iCloud Location Servers, (3) when a device is offline and (4) when a device's location is over 5-hours old and (5) when tracking is paused. The messages from AirPods and iPods are only displayed when their Event Log screen is displayed.
3. OTHER - Minor code corrections and cleanup.

v3.0.1.1 - 3/24/2024
.......................
1. ICLOUD-0.LOG FILE (Fixed) - The icloud-0.log file was not being created when the HA 'logger:' statement was not in the HA configuration.yaml file.

v3.0.1 - 3/20/2024
.......................
1. UPDATE SENSOR & DEVICE TRACKER ENTITIES (Improvement) - Changed the method of updating these items at the request of @balloob (Paulus Schousten, HA Founder) to prevent a potential Home Assistant lockup when doing an update.
2. LOG FILE (Improvement) - Changed the method of updating the iCloud3 log files. Also changed some of the record formatting to improve readability.
2. WAZE & CALC DISTANCE SENSORS (Fixed) - They were not being created.
3. UPDATE DEVICES CONFIGURE SCREEN (Fixed) - The Picture parameter was listing every image file in the all of the www/ sub-directories. A filter was added to limit the search to specific directories. The filter is defined on the Tracking and Other Parameters screen. Only the first 25 image files in a directory will be displayed to prevent overloading the HA dropdown list handler.
4. FIXED INTERVAL (Improvement) - The lowest interval was reduced from 5-minutes to 3-minutes.
5. DIRECTION OF TRAVEL (Improvement) - Changed the way this is being updated. If the distance from Home is more than 400m/250mi, it will be set to FarAway.
6. STATIONARY ZONE (Fixed) - The second device to enter an existing Stationary Zone was not saving the Stationary Zone info correctly.
